Today, I was reading some blogs on [Tynan.com](https://tynan.com/blog/2021/02/27/fifteen/). I draw a lot of inspiration from this random man's writing, so when I had the chance to revisit some of his posts, it made me reflect on my journey and why I started this blog 10 months ago. For Tynan, he began writing after successfully implementing a [polyphasic sleep schedule](https://www.polyphasic.net/). His post went viral, which led him to continue sharing his life and adventures with a growing audience. Over the past 15 years, his writing has evolved from documenting wild adventures to offering general life advice and self-improvement insights.

Although I don't have a large audience or any notable writings yet, I resonate with Tynan's blogging journey and the benefits that come from it. I originally started this blog to document the biking trip I was embarking on at the time. Over the past ten months since the inception of kotakun.blog, I've written about a variety of topics (20 posts so far!), and I've enjoyed the freedom to express my thoughts clearly and openly.

I've realized that I enjoy writing about things that leave an intentional impression. It's an incredible feeling to touch someone's life in some way, however small. I try not to give direct advice or expect readers to follow anything I say, but I like to imagine that they take something away from my writing. I find it rewarding, not just because I might have written something that makes a slight difference in their life, but also because it's a tangible way to feel that someone understands me a little better. It's one of the reasons I keep posting and continue striving to improve my writing.

Writing is also a great pastime for me, where I get "lost in the sauce," exploring my thoughts. It's also a perfect time to listen to new music and dive into different genres, which often sparks inspiration for new topics. Writing helps me improve my thought process, imagination, memory, and, of course, my writing skills. Most importantly, it's a fun way to look back and see what was on my mind at a given time. I think it'll be exciting to reflect on how my thoughts have evolved and what's changed as I settle down and live a life I can't fully imagine right now.

Consistency hasn't been my strong suit, but I've been pretty proud of most things I've shared and want to continue blogging for the foreseeable future. Some goals I have for this blog are to write every week, explore more interesting thoughts, and start a segment where I do research on a topic that interests me and share it with the world. It's exciting to see how this blog will continue to develop!

Anyways, cheers to (almost) a year of blogging! Thanks for reading, let's catch up if we haven't talked in a while c:
