  If you're finally getting an email for this post, welcome back! I've purposefully been omitting email notifications on posts because some posts frankly are just me rambling about things you probably aren't interested in. However, this is the 1st anniversary of this blog, so I'm bringing you guys back out. If you have the time, please feel free to read the other posts!

One year ago today, I posted my first ever blog, [Starting a Blog](/blog/starting-a-blog).

WOOOO WE DID IT!!! I finally pulled through and committed to a project.

Here are some stats of the blog:
1. **23** posts (**24** including this)
2. **87** comments (thanks, guys :))
3. **3** redesigns
4. I am not 100% sure (my free trial of analytics won't show me past 30 days), but at least **150** unique viewers
5. Viewers from **12** different countries (idk how some people even found my blog) [furthest access is from Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª]
6. Total of **97** GitHub commits (27 + 41 + 29) (3 different repos over the 3 upgrades)

Although my posting schedule was pretty sporadic, overall, I'm pretty happy with the content I've written on this blog. 23 posts is not too shabby!

This year has felt like the longest year I've ever lived through. I accomplished a lot, and in return, I think my character was shaped for the better. However, this year has taught me that moments are fleeting and life will not stop at all for you. Writing posts for this blog (or even notes I haven't posted) has helped me slow down and appreciate each memory I have gained this year.

Writing also has brought some pretty tangible improvements to my life. I've become a better writer, thinker, and listener. Since starting this blog, I've noticed I get more excited to hear in-depth about any topic and immediately try to formulate my own take so I can write it up. This blog has also opened some doors to stronger friendships, notably due to more exposure to friends who text me occasionally after reading my posts!

I'm extremely grateful for all the people I've met this year and the things I've done. I want to continue being my authentic self and see where that takes me next year!

Some future plans for this website:
1. Continue posting! I may try to challenge myself with a smaller segment to share things I learned that week. Not sure how that would work yet.
2. Post smaller notes - each post doesn't need to be an essay (this is probably the biggest bottleneck for posts this year).
3. Development-wise, make this fully OSS compliant so anyone can download the repo and host their own blog with an easy terminal command.

I'd say this small project is a success! :)

Thanks for keeping up with my life! Here's to another year!!!!
