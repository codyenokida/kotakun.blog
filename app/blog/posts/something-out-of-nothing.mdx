HELLOOO!

It's been a while since I've posted (so if you're here reading this, thank you for checking in!). Right now, I'm back in Irvine!

Aside from some much-needed quality time with my parents, I've been dedicating most of my free time to working on an idea I had a couple of months ago (and hopefully, I'll be able to share what I'm building soon here on the blog!).

It's exciting to bring an idea of my own to life; it's been a liberating experience to use everything I've learned over the years for something completely mine. Although it's a small project, building it out has been a huge task. Compared to this blog (which I also made from scratch), there's so much more to think about: scalability, data organization, choosing the right tech, and figuring out how to turn real-world things into structured data. I keep finding new edge cases, changing how I want things to look, and even going back to tweak features so they actually make sense.

I can't imagine the complexity that goes into building something on a larger scale with millions of users or something far more intricate than what I'm doing. Then add in a whole team of people with their own visions and ideas… it's insanely wild to think about all the effort and coordination behind the stuff we use daily.

Creating something out of nothing takes serious thought and effort, and even though my project is on the smaller side, it's been an eye-opener. It's made me appreciate the insane amount of work that's gone into the infrastructure all around us. Walking around my neighborhood, I find myself in awe of things I used to take for granted: paved roads, organized sidewalks, the trees lining the streets, the convenience of stores nearby. The fact that I can hop in a car and drive hundreds of miles, or that we have sturdy homes that protect us from the weather—none of it just happened by chance. Someone took the time, thought it through, and built something out of nothing.

In a world where so much already exists, I think it's more important than ever to try making something of your own, just to see what goes into it. It changes how you look at everything around you, and it makes you appreciate just how much thought and care are behind the scenes in this beautiful world we're part of.

All this makes me want to, when the day comes, step up and make something that can make a positive impact on the community I live in.

Cheers! c:
