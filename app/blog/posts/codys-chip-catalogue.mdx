So I've mentioned in a [previous post](/blog/something-out-of-nothing) that I've been working on a fun project!

It's finally time to unravel the curtains behind the (not-so) hidden work I've put countless hours of ideation and creation into.

_**Drumroll, pleaseâ€¦â€¦.**_

It's time to present [Cody's Chip Catalogue](https://www.codyschips.xyz) / [https://www.codyschips.xyz](https://www.codyschips.xyz)!!!

**YES!** It's an online catalogue of potato (and more) chips ðŸ˜†. With _C3_ (lol), you will be able to search chips by flavor, country, shape, and brand, find chips you enjoy, get recommendations catered to your preferences, and search reviews of chips from thousands (future projections from the current 10 reviewers) of users.

At the time of writing, Cody's Chip Catalogue has 22 authenticated users (most of which are completely random internet strangers) and 1,253 chips indexed!

_Here are some interesting stats:_

### 700ish (?) users!

The platform I use to host the website (Vercel) only stores the last 30 days of analytics data. The day I posted on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chips/comments/1i32r4o/making_the_largest_potato_chip_database_please/), I got around 500 unique visitors. Not too shabby!

    },
  ]}
/>


### Visitors from 31 different countries!

Honestly, this is the metric I love the most. It's cool to think that some guys living in South Africa and Guernsey (I've never heard of this place before analytics) really like my website and visited almost 40 different chips.

### 41k viewers on Reddit

Reddit's doom-scroll is real, and I'd like to say I've successfully contributed to it! A semi-successful post in a niche subreddit can garner a lot of eyes! That's a pretty cool thing. I think I'd like to continue with this.

### 1 business proposal

I've had a business owner message me to advertise his snack website on my chip catalogue! If anyone clicks his links, I'll earn some affiliate revenue. That's huge validation that this could potentially be a good business model!

~~

Future plans:
- Continue to add chips
- Create a TikTok / Instagram account for more traction and for fun
- Try to get more reviewers on the website
- Get my first paycheck from Cody's Chip Catalogue

I got to practice front-end web development, and design, and learn new modern frameworks to host a product for the world. In fact, this website single-handedly got me a job offer (omg this is big news and there will be an update post at a later time). I learned that if you're an engineer, it's extremely vital to show that you **_CAN_** make things!

Anyway, it's been fun building out this project! I plan to nurture this website and see its growth. My path to be the chip mogul of the world starts NOW!

Thanks for reading!
