As we welcome 2025, I find myself reflecting on a very (I mean very) long 2024. While I could recap the major events (which you can find in my previous posts), I want to focus solely on reflections of this year, results of my 2024 resolutions, and intentions for the year ahead.

## 2024 Reflection

The first three quarters of the year were incredible! I finally scratched that itch for traveling and exploring the world. I feel like a completely different person compared to who I was this time last year. Personal growth has been a recurring theme, and oddly enough, I can sense my frontal lobe maturing, a pure biological fact that I think has played a role in my development. I also spent a lot of time with Ashley, learning a great deal about maintaining a consistent relationship. There's still plenty I need to work on, but I'm grateful for the progress I've made.

The last quarter of the year slowed down a bit, but it gave me a chance to focus on family and some personal projects. I've recently found a new thrill in indie hacking (essentially building software solo) and I'm excited to dive into it while I have the time. That said, I've felt somewhat stuck when it comes to my career. I'm not a genius, nor do I have the kind of work credentials that instantly command respect, and I often find myself comparing my journey to others. People on Twitter, for instance, seem to have been creating and building remarkably complex projects since their teenage years. While I've developed a strong drive now, it sometimes feels like I'll always be playing catch-up to achieve the kind of career I envision for myself.

Still, I enjoy learning new things and spend much of my time doing just that. Hopefully, the seeds I'm planting now will bear fruit down the line. For now, I'd say I'm ambitious, perhaps even woefully optimistic, but I believe that mindset might just be my greatest asset.

Overall, one of the best years of my life! 

## 2024 Resolutions Review

‚úÖ **Achieved:** 
- Read 15 books, including standouts like "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh‚Äù (fun fantasy) and ‚ÄúCrossing the Line" (Story about Apartheid).
- Maintained consistent writing and blogging.
- Started work on an entertaining side project.

üöß **Partial Progress:** 
- Mandarin learning (inconsistent but ongoing)
- Running (completed one half-marathon, maintaining regular exercise) 
- Squats carrying Ashley (reached 25, target was 40) 

‚ùå **Not Achieved:** 
- Muscle-up goal 
- Documentary filming project (this one was far-fetched and pretty random)

Looking back, the goals I set for 2024 were half-assed \<,\< - and the results reflect that. Working out wasn't particularly a priority for me, since I'm pretty active in my daily life. I didn't get to pursue something new (hobby-wise) since I didn't get to stay put for a long period of time, so that's something I want to change in 2025.

Most of the resolutions I didn't complete were consistency based. It's a common pattern in my life, so it's something I actively want to dispel. 

## 2025 Goals

Here are my goals for this year:

üèãÔ∏è **Health & Fitness:**
- Work out 3 times per week, consistently 
- Achieve full splits through regular stretching (ick?)
- Complete 40 squats carrying Ashley (retry of this year, if I'm consistent I should be able to blow past this)
- Do some sort of fun fitness challenge

üí™ **Personal Development:**
- Dedicate 100+ hours to Mandarin practice 
- Write 24 blog posts (2 a month)
- Continue reading regularly (and read more foreign books (thanks yuri I'm stealing this one))
- Explore creative writing (I want to give a stab at writing a fiction story)

üè¢ **Career & Projects:**
- Maintain existing personal projects 
- Build an indie product generating $50/month 
- Develop hands-on skills through woodworking

üåê **Community Engagement:**
-  Volunteer for carpentry studio or nature path restoration (anything in nature)
- Do more ocean stuff if I'm still living near!

I'm doubling down on the consistency thing to really test myself. This year I have a different mindset on these resolutions and I want to keep myself accountable for all of them!

I'm excited to tackle the new year and looking to see what I have to say next year about these goals I've set for myself. Above 70% completion would be awesome (too optimistic???). You got this Kota-kun!! Go Go Go!
