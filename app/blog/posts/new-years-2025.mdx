As we welcome 2025, I find myself reflecting on very long 2024. While I could recap the major events (which you can find in my previous posts), I want to focus on my personal growth, achievements, and set intentions for the year ahead.

## 2024 Reflection

Overall, a great year. Q1-Q3 were splendid in terms finally itching that that bone of traveling and exploring the world. It feels like I'm an unrecognizable man from who I was this time last year. I've grown a lot to say the least. I can actively feel my frontal lobe finally maturing as I reach my mid-twenties. I spent a lot of time with Ashley and learned a lot in terms of keeping a consistent relationship. I still have lots to be better at though. 

Q4 was slightly slower paced, but I got to spend a lot of time with family and some personal projects. I found some new found thrill in indie hacking (basically 1 man software building) and I want to do that while I have the time. The past few weeks I've felt particularly stuck in terms of career. Unless it's something completely outfield, it feels like if I end up taking a new job, I'll end up in the same loop cycle that I was at C3. Although I keep going back and forward with whether I want to pursue that kind of thing, I still have a deep urge inside me to make my own thing and enjoy learning new skills that come along with it. So hopefully I can get around to that more in 2025.

## 2024 Resolutions Review (40% Success Rate) 

‚úÖ **Achieved:** 
- Read 15 books, including standouts like "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh" and "Crossing the Line" 
- Maintained consistent writing and blogging 
- Started work on an entertaining side project 

üöß **Partial Progress:** 
- Mandarin learning (inconsistent but ongoing) 
- Running (completed one half-marathon, maintaining regular exercise) 
- Squats carrying Ashley (reached 25, target was 40) 

‚ùå **Not Achieved:** 
- Muscle-up goal 
- Documentary filming project (this one was far-fetched and pretty random)

Most of the resolutions I didn't complete were consistency based. It's a common pattern in my life, so it's something I actively want to dispel. 

## 2025 Goals

Here are my goals for this year:

üèãÔ∏è **Health & Fitness:**
- Work out 3 times per week, consistently 
- Achieve full splits through regular stretching 
- Complete 40 squats carrying Ashley 

üí™ **Personal Development:** 
- Dedicate 100+ hours to Mandarin practice 
- Write 24 blog posts 
- Continue reading regularly 
- Explore creative writing 

üè¢ **Career & Projects:** 
- Maintain existing personal projects 
- Build an indie product generating $50/month 
- Develop hands-on skills through woodworking

üåê **Community Engagement:** 
- Volunteer for carpentry studio or nature path restoration

Looking ahead to 2025, I'm setting ambitious but achievable goals focused on health, personal growth, and career development. I'm doubling down on the consistency thing to really test myself.

I don't really like new years resolutions. It's publically setting goals that are a bit arbitrary and can be hard to maintain. But it's fun to look back and see what I was interested in at this time last year. 

I'm excited to tackle the new year and looking to see what I have to say next year about these goals I've set for myself. Above 50% completion would be awesome. You got this Kota-kun!! Go Go Go!
