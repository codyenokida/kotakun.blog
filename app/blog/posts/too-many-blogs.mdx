If you've been around since the early days of this blog, you've probably noticed that **kotakun.blog** looks completely different almost every time you visit. The theme, typography, icons, copywriting, and even the coding frameworks have all gone through some major changes with each new version. Since I've spent a lot of time tweaking and iterating these designs, I thought it'd be fun to dive into the history of the blog and share some important lessons I've picked up along the way.

## Version 1

The first version of the blog was the simplest in terms of layout, structure, and complexity. Since I designed and developed it myself, I felt it genuinely was my creation and fulfilled the vision I had in mind. Each post was paired with a song that I felt enhanced the reading experience. I prepared this version before my biking trip, so I could update it on the go with just my phone.

Beyond the user interface you may have seen, V1 included an admin dashboard where I could post, edit, and delete entries. I could rearrange sections, and any edits would dynamically update the blog posts. There were a bunch of optimizations that could be implemented, however, considering I built it in just two weeks before heading to Vietnam, I think the architecture was pretty well thought out and executed.

## Version 2

V1 of the website was retired just four months after its launch, making way for the flashy new V2 of kotakun.blog. V2 was inspired by [family.co](https://family.co/), a web3 wallet that gained praise on Twitter for its smooth user experience and tailored animations. Their approach to branding and component interactivity was impressive and inspiring, so I tried to incorporate some of that into this rendition.

However, perhaps because I drew so much inspiration from a single source, the website didn't quite feel like "kotakun", and its lifespan reflected that, lasting only 1.5 months — less than half of V1's duration. Despite its brief run, V2 had some significant achievements that I'm proud of. I learned a new framework in Next.js, gained a deeper knowledge of web development optimizations like SSR and proper use of CDNs, practiced Framer Motion animations (I now feel confident enough to build more complex animations), and had the chance to draw and design all the assets, something I usually don't get to do.

## Version 3

And now we've arrived at the current version (though if you're reading this at a later date, it might have changed AGAIN...). Although it's simple and not so impressive in design, I think this one feels the most like "me," and it's also a significant leap forward in terms of code quality. In V3, I've implemented more background work and scripts, making it much easier for me to upload posts. I'm using MDX now and have optimized workflows for image uploading and dynamic slug creation.
While I had to let go of the cool post-creation flow from V1, the writing experience is much better now that I'm not on the go and have a laptop with me at all times.

Over these last six months, I've armed myself with new knowledge and expanded my skill set. One clear takeaway from developing this site is that **more reps = more skills**.

While that's definitely important, another aspect that kept getting challenged throughout this process was my own taste.

Am I building something cool? Does that animation feel right? Does this blog feel like me? What **_do_** I even like?

Rebuilding the same concept over and over might seem like a waste of time (and yeah, I've definitely spent way too much time on this kotakun.blog series), but I realized that taste and originality are also products of continuous reps. I've often struggled with feeling like I needed to follow a specific template or stick to instructions to succeed (maybe it's a result of my upbringing or the U.S. education system). But really focusing on your own thing — building, understanding, and refining it — will help you feel more confident in anything you do. In some strange way, I feel more prepared than ever to pursue my own life with no judgment or expectation from others.

I've developed my own philosophy that consumption is important, but so is creation. It's when the two come together that we grow as people and find some fulfillment in this scary world.

So, make something! Draw something! Get out there and do something, and I'm sure you'll learn more (and have fun) than just the skills.
