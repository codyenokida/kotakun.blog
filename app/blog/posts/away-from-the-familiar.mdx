As of September 27, 2024, the day I am finalizing this blog post, it has been **306 days** since my life as a software engineer took an unexpected turn. In these 306 days, a LOT has changed. Through all the diverse adventures I've experienced, I can confidently say I've become more cultured and knowledgeable about this complex world we live in. I became infinitely grateful for the Earth we stand on and developed new and interesting views on both the small and big things about the world.

I'm very aware of the privilege that's allowed me to be where I am today, so my aim in sharing these thoughts is twofold: to bring clarity to my own reflections, and to offer you a perspective into what brews inside the head of an unemployed traveler from a standpoint that hopefully isn't too _out-of-touch_ with you folks.

## Detachment and Delusion

  In this context, I use detachment and delusion with a loose definition of
  having no ties to society, observing without judgment, and acting strangely.

When you take a long-term break from your usual routine, a feeling of detachment begins. Especially on an extended escape like mine, where there wasn't a clear goal or destination, this detachment can grow into something I've come to coin as _**extreme detachment and delulu**_. Let me share a few examples to give you a better sense of what I've been feeling.

The first significant period of detachment occurred during my [bicycle trip](/blog/vietnam-one). Spending a considerable time in solitude while cycling naturally led me to ponder life's purpose. Constantly, I would remind myself of the _**whys**_ of my purpose and the _**whys**_ of life in general. However, I never came up with a great answer. The only thing I realized was that I was far off the path I originally set for myself in college searching for jobs on LinkedIn.

The second wave of detachment hit when I returned to San Francisco and reconnected with old colleagues. In the three months I had been away, I had traveled to three new countries, immersing myself in new cultures and experiences, while their lives seemed largely unchanged. They asked me how the trip had changed me, and I could not find the right words to describe it. I felt I should have had deeper insights to share, but all I could offer was that I had a great time biking through unfamiliar landscapes.

The truth is, it wasn't that the trip lacked meaning — it was that the changes were too internal, too subtle to articulate at the time. Looking back now, I realize the shifts were deep but invisible, reshaping how I think in ways I couldn't grasp then (and even now). What seems so obvious about what I think just wasn't the case before. However, my growth isn't a quality of superiority over my peers but a quality of difference. This lapse has been adding to this growing sense of detachment from my world 300 days ago (this all writes so dramatically, but it's really how I feel after being away for so long).

As a romantic and dreamer, I imagine my future filled with purpose, excitement, and adventure. That includes daydreaming about operating my own business or building a kick-ass katsu shop. However, my logical side tries to pull me back to what I know and what works — finding a job with a 401k matching and a good salary. While I wholeheartedly agree that this is a valid and natural path for me, there's also a form of delusion of grandeur that's developed over these 300 days, making me think I'm capable of the things I daydream about. Detachment and a healthy dose of delusion are vital for success (in my opinion), but without a way to measure them, how do you know when you've crossed the line from healthy to unrealistic? Still, the more I stay grounded in the belief systems I've strengthened over these 300 days, the more I think the scale of what can be considered a "healthy" delusion is much broader than we might initially assume. We really are capable of more with the right mindset and enough runway.

## What Are You Working For

I know this might sound a bit naïve, but I've developed a whole new framework for how to think about money. For the longest time, I worked hard to earn money so I could buy a house and provide for my family and future children. That's a huge financial goal, so naturally, planning ahead and aiming for a successful career seemed like the right path to realizing that dream.

But now, I've come to see that investing in myself—through travel and meaningful experiences—may actually be the best investment I can make for my future children and the people around me. What I've learned from being away from home for the past 300 days is that learning how to truly understand the world is one of the most vital skills anyone can have. I'd even go out on a limb to say that this is far more valuable than anything money could buy when it comes to improving the lives of my children. It would have a much deeper impact on how they see and navigate the world.

Even if I don't make as much money as I once did (and of course, having more wouldn't hurt), I'd consider it a win for my family if I find an occupation that fulfills me and helps me develop practical life skills. In the long run, that personal growth will likely be worth more than any financial gain for what I can provide to the people around me. I really hope I can reap the rewards from this mentality and not have it bite me in the ass! :)

## Back To Normal

There's always that looming sense of doom when I think about returning to the traditional working world — making money, paying taxes, and building "value." Lately, I've been disillusioned by the endless possibilities beyond corporate life. As much as I want to break away from what I was doing before, it's hard not to consider it as an option. After all, I got my degree to land a job, and there are people in my life I don't want to disappoint.

But the idea of returning to my old life doesn't feel like a path I want to pursue with passion. I'm still young and probably a bit foolish, so who knows how far this "delusion" will take me, but I want to live a life that, when I look back, feels worth it — one that makes me think, damn that was so cool I did that.

I don't want to get ahead of myself, but as I look back on these past few months, I can't help but wince at the thought of my profession, where I spend my days staring at a screen. This extended detachment, not just a short vacation, has made it painfully clear: I don't want to keep pursuing software engineering in the long term. I really enjoy learning about the world and the interesting and quirky things within it. Although I still love creating websites and apps and probably will continue to make them in my free time, it gave me a strange conviction to try something new when I get back to the States and adjust to my new chapter ahead.
It's really been a beautiful time these past few months… I'm back in the States in a few weeks, ready to tackle what comes next.

Thank you for reading, enjoy life and have a great day :)

  It seems this post has become more of a reflection of how afraid I am about
  the uncertainty of my future regarding my occupation. DW, I'm doing completely
  fine and hopefully, I will have something to show for all this yapping I'm
  doing. :)
