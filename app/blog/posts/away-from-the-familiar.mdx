As of September 26, 2024, it's been nearly 300 days since my life as a software engineer took an unexpected turn. In these 300 days, a lot has happened. I bicycled through Southeast Asia, ran a marathon, started to blog (semi-seriously), traveled around Taiwan for 1.5 months, and am now in Japan for another 1.5 months.

This year has been a whirlwind of experiences. I'm acutely aware of the privilege that's allowed me to be where I am today. My aim in sharing these thoughts is twofold: to bring clarity to my own reflections and to offer readers a perspective into what brews inside the head of an unemployed traveler.

### Detachment

These 300 days away from home, rich with diverse experiences, have offered crucial periods of detachment. I've found that more detachment leads to more angles from which to analyze one's life.

The first significant period of detachment occurred in Southeast Asia. Long stretches of road cycling provided ample time for contemplating my future. Being in a completely different environment and spending considerable time in solitude naturally led me to ponder life's purpose. This grand adventure emphasized the 'why' behind my previous corporate job, making me question what I was truly working for.

The second significant period of detachment occurred upon my return to San Francisco, where I reconnected with former colleagues. While their lives remained largely unchanged, mine had experienced 3 new countries. This stark contrast, however, prompted me to question: Is such change inherently positive? I could've gone my entire life without knowing what Vietnam was like and I probably still would've lived a fruitful life, I mean my colleagues are still doing great. What am I doing all this for, and what comes from it?

This third period of detachment, happening right now as I sit in an outdoor onsen, has me thinking deeply about what I want out of my life. I know it's a privilege to be in this position. Still, I believe everyone deserves the space to have wiggle room not just to survive, but to reflect on their purpose and what they want from life.

### Not Nihilism 

One mindset I've embraced over the past few months is this: it doesn't matter what others think, or how things play out in the long run—we all die anyways, so why not just go for it? Everything comes and goes, and memories fade just as quickly as they're made. We live on this massive planet, floating in endless space, and because nothing really matters in the grand scheme of things, that's exactly why doing something bold or meaningful is worth it. So one day, you can look back and say, yeah, I did that.

### What Are You Working For

I know this might sound a bit naïve, maybe even narcissistic, but I've come to a realization worth mentioning. I used to believe that I was working hard to earn money so I could buy a house and provide an amazing childhood for my future children. That's a huge financial goal. But now, I've come to see that investing in myself—through travel and meaningful experiences—may be the best investment I can make for my children and the people around me. Becoming the best version of myself, through lessons learned outside the classroom, will likely have a deeper impact on how my kids see and navigate the world.

Even if I don't make as much money as I once did (and of course, having more wouldn't hurt), I'd consider it a win for my family if I find a job that fulfills me and helps me develop practical life skills. In the long run, that personal growth will likely be worth more than any financial gain. I'd say this mindset is probably beneficial, but it may bite me in the ass in the future lol.

### Back To Normal

There's always that looming sense of doom when I think about returning to the traditional working world—making money, paying taxes, and building "value." Lately, I've been disillusioned by the endless possibilities beyond corporate life, which has become the default path for most US university grads. As much as I want to break away from what I was doing before, it's hard not to consider it as an option. After all, I got my degree to land a job, and there are people in my life I don't want to disappoint.

But the idea of returning to my old life doesn't feel like a path I want to pursue with passion. I'm still young and probably a bit foolish, so who knows how far this "delusion" will take me—but I want to live a life that, when I look back, feels worth it. One that's cool, in my own way.

I don't want to get ahead of myself, but as I look back on these past few months, I can't help but wince at the thought of my profession, where I spend my days staring at a screen. This extended detachment, not just a short vacation, has made it painfully clear: I don't want to keep pursuing software engineering in the long term. Although I still love creating websites and apps and probably will continue to make them in my free time, it gave me a strange conviction to try something new when I get back to the States and adjust to my new chapter ahead.

It's really been a beautiful time these past few months… I'm back in the States in a few weeks, ready to tackle what comes next.

Thank you for reading, enjoy life and have a great day :)
