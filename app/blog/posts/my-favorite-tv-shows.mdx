When someone asks me what my favorite TV show is, my go-to answer is **_One Piece_** (yes, I will include anime on this list).

It's not hard to justify why I think it's so good. It's one of the longest running anime series (manga released in 1997). It takes place in a masterfully crafted world, and it features some of the world's most iconic characters and important narratives. Superpowers are cool. The anime is silly and goofy, yet somehow extremely meaningful and emotional. 

Although no one can deny its truly epic nature, for those who have watched it (including the attempters who never caught up), I have never seen anyone who has claimed it to be their favorite show. And I totally get it - it's tremendously long and even has a list of episodes to [skip](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/fantasy/anime/one-piece-filler-list/) because they are boring or not relevant to the story.

A huge reason I love One Piece so much is that I've been watching the show for more than 15 years now. Yes, it's slow at times, and the characters might be cringe, but the show has consistently stayed with me as I grew to who I am today. I appreciate the huge undertaking the author has gone to continuously build this grand world and in which he graciously invites us. 

The story of One Piece has been **_marinated_** to be a fantastical story for me. I'm pretty sure no show can overthrow its place on my favorite TV show list.

Just like all things in life, much enjoyment and fulfillment comes from **marination**. A well-seasoned steak, broth cooked overnight, friendships, careers, and romantic relationships. It takes time and patience for a foundation to take root.

Obviously, you'll need to pick the right item to marinate. No matter how long you marinate a pebble, it will never be as good as marinated chicken.

There are a ton of amazing shows I love that are much shorter and binge-able, although I think those shows sit in a completely different category simply due to the pacing and plot line. I won't even attempt to discuss movies because they are a whole other ballpark.

Ok that's enough yap; here are some shows I think are pretty amazing and creative. (Warning of anime in this list and in also sorted in no particular order)

- Lost (first couple of seasons)
- Fargo (2nd tv series)
- Fringe (loved this when I was in middle school)
- X-files (high school I think??)
