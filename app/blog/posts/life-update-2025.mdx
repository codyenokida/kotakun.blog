HELLOOOOO!

It's been a while since I last updated this blog. While posting on this blog has been on my mind since my last post, the past few weeks have been quite hectic, and significant changes have been unfolding, which prompted me to wait until the waves settled.

That said - I'm excited to announce that Kota-kun, Ashley, and Filby have officially moved to the new playground of 2025…

🗽🚕🐀 **New York City** 🗽🚕🐀

It's been 2 weeks since I set foot here. Since then, I walked around a LOT and started a new job. My first impressions of New York City are frankly amazing. I love the convenience of the subway system, the variety of food options, and most importantly, the diversity of people. Not just racially, but you see people from different walks of life, different ages, and cultures constantly. It's amazingly refreshing compared to where I'm originally from.

Many warned me that New York would be dirty and overcrowded. While that's true in some areas, I've been pleasantly surprised to find these descriptions wildly misleading overall. Only in certain concentrated spots does this reputation hold up, but as a whole, Manhattan feels incredibly charming and vibrant. 

As spring unfolds right before our eyes, I find myself grateful to be in this place at this particular moment, just as my new season begins.

We've settled down in the Upper East Side, where I can only describe it as quaint and magical. It's quiet, but also somehow bustling with life. We've found a small, but cozy apartment that we're slowly making our own.

Although this move is huge and surprising, the lifestyle shift hasn't been as jarring as expected. Maybe that's just aging, or perhaps I'm simply more adaptable to change now.

While I don't want to be someone whose location defines them, I'm making a conscious effort to romanticize my surroundings and shape my perspective with it. I'm excited to spend the next few years here! I hope to grow as a person, be more confident with my worldview, and share that with others. I'm very lucky to be here with these circumstances.

Life really does move quickly.

Anyways, please come visit me. 🥺

Thanks for reading!

_**TLDR:** got a new job and moved to NYC!_
