          <b>Currently:</b> I&apos;m in Taiwan!!! I&apos;m so excited to be here
          and see what this place has to offer. I&apos;ve spent the past two
          weeks with Ashley and her relatives. We spent the first half with her
          father&apos;s family in Songshan District. We spent the following week
          going on a 12 person roadtrip (cousins, aunts, uncles included) family
          in Songshan District. We spent the following week going on a 12 person
          roadtrip (cousins, aunts, uncles included) down to Kenting National
          Park. Fun family time and was a fun time to meet all the folks. Taiwan
          is hot and humid, but has some amazing food and great culture. Career
          wise, I&apos;ve been interviewing. I made it pretty far into
          interviews at one place but rejected for not having the right amount
          of experience. It&apos;s tough to be a junior in this market. Tough
          luck, but I&apos;m confident in my skills so I&apos;ll keep on
          grinding! 2 more weeks in Taiwan and then I&apos;m off to Japan!
