        I haven&apos;t been very good at updating this portion of the blog, but here I am now.
        <br />
        <br />
        It&apos;s Sat midnight, finished up a long day of visiting Astoria for my wood working class and house cleaning.
        <br />
        <br />
      2 months into New York, I&apos;m doing great! Exploring, working, and living. Work has been pretty fulfilling overall 
      and it&apos;s a great experience to work alongside some crazy talented and smart people. It&apos;s also fun to be able to 
      work on a product you think is cool and I enjoy working on it and putting in the time and effort to grow it.
        <br />
      <br />
      Ashley and I have been getting more acclimated (more me than her though). Working 
      everyday and having that routine helps a lot. I started going to a wood working studio which I&apos;ve always wanted 
      to do, and that&apos;s been fun. I&apos;m planning to make a coffee table and trying to be ambitious and intentional with 
      my design.
      <br />
      <br />
      I&apos;m super grateful to be here.

      "I'm currently updating this portion of the blog from Tokyo, Japan!!! I'm back in my home country where my parents grew up, showing Ashley around the city. Japan is currently experiencing Typhoon 10. It's an extremely strong typhoon, but we're staying safe and dry. It's been a fun trip so far and I'm glad we're spending time in a place I'm comfortable with. // I've done a lot of reflecting on my life recently. Some moments have been filled with doubts about myself and how I want to move forward in life. I want to settle down and commit to a long-term stay where I can grow a community and work hard to find some fulfillment in my work and craft. It's a bad addiction to keep thinking about the future and how I want to live, so I'm currently taking it day by day to enjoy my time here. That includes shopping, movies, and improving this blog and other things to be ready for what's to come. So grateful for everything that's transpired over the past few months and I'm excited for what's to come.\n\nAnyways, watched the Greatest Showman and it was such a great movie with so many layers. Looking to take some time and watch a good movie, documentary, or listen to some good music all month.",

We spent the first half with her father's family in Songshan District. We spent the following week going on a 12 person roadtrip (cousins, aunts, uncles included) down to Kenting National Park. Fun family time and was a fun time to meet all the folks. Taiwan is hot and humid, but has some amazing food and great culture. Career wise, I've been interviewing. I made it pretty far into interviews at one place but rejected for not having the right amount of experience. It's tough to be a junior in this market. Tough luck, but I'm confident in my skills so I'll keep on grinding! 2 more weeks in Taiwan and then I'm off to Japan!",
