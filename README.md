# kotakun.blog

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It was inspired by [Portfolio Blog Starter](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog). However, this version is built with Next.js 15 (canary) and Tailwind CSS 4 (alpha). There was some complications with the os architecture between packages so i opted to downgrade to Next.js 14.

Includes:

- MDX and Markdown support
- Optimized for SEO (sitemap, robots, JSON-LD schema)
- RSS Feed
- Dynamic OG images
- Syntax highlighting
- Tailwind v4
- Vercel Speed Insights / Web Analytics

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
